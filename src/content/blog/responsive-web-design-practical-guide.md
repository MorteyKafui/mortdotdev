Responsive web design is an approach that ensures web pages look good on all devices by using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. It allows content to adapt dynamically to the user's screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience.

.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
