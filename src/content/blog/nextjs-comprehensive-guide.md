Welcome to the world of Next.js, the React framework that simplifies building modern and performant web applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover the basics of Next.js, including routing, data fetching, and deployment.

## Understanding Next.js Basics

### What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables the building of server-rendered React applications with ease. It provides a powerful and flexible environment for developers to create dynamic web pages while maintaining the benefits of server-side rendering.

### Key Features of Next.js

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows rendering React components on the server, improving performance and SEO.

2. **Automatic Code Splitting:** The framework automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, delivering only the necessary JavaScript to the client.

3. **File-Based Routing:** Next.js simplifies routing by following a file-based system, making it intuitive and easy to organize.

## Getting Started with Next.js

### Installation and Setup

Start a new Next.js project using the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
