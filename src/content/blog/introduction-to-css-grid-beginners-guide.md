Embarking on your web development journey? Let's delve into the world of CSS Grid, an innovative layout system that empowers you to create intricate designs with simplicity. This beginner's guide will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of CSS Grid.

## Understanding CSS Grid Basics

### What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to design complex web layouts with ease. It introduces a grid-based layout model, making it efficient to create both rows and columns, unlike the one-dimensional nature of Flexbox.

### Key CSS Grid Terminology

Before diving into practical examples, let's familiarize ourselves with some fundamental CSS Grid terminology:

- **Grid Container:** The parent element that holds the entire grid.
- **Grid Items:** The children of the grid container.
- **Grid Lines:** The horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid.
- **Grid Tracks:** The spaces between the grid lines, forming rows and columns.

## Setting Up CSS Grid

### Creating a Grid Container

To start using CSS Grid, set the CSS property `display: grid;` on the container element. This transforms the container into a grid container, and its children become grid items.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
